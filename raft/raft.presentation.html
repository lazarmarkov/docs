# Consensus algorithms
## Deep dive into Raft

class: center, middle

## Why do we need a consensus protocol?

---

class: center, middle

## Example: Replicated log

## Example: A replicated log

Replicated log properties:
* Append-only data structure.
* Each entry is replicated to every node the cluster.
* Each node has the same sequence of entries in its log.

---

## Example: A replicated log + fault tolerance

Replicated log properties:
* Append-only data structure.
* Each entry is replicated to every node the cluster.
* Each node has the same sequence of entries in its log.

System properties:
* The system should be able to continue operation when some of the nodes fail.

## OK, so we have a replicated log that handles failing nodes. How hard can it be?

---

## Internet as a communication channel

Unreliable as messages can be:
* lost
* delayed
* unacknoledged

If node _A_ can't communicate with node _B_, it doesn't mean _B_ is down,
it only means _B_ is not responding. There might be a networok paritition and further
_B_ may even be serving clients.

## Crap!

## How do we guarantee each node has the same sequence in its log?

---

## Formalizing the requirements for the replicated log:

* Data consistency across the cluster
* Gracefull handling of faulty nodes

---

## The CAP Theorem
* __Consistency:__ all nodes see the same data at the same time
* __Availability:__ node failures do not prevent survivors from continuing to operate
* __Partition tolerance:__ the system continues to operate despite node or network failure

## How can Raft help?

---

## Raft solves the consensus problem


__Consensus__ involves multiple servers agreeing on values. Once they reach a decision on a value, that decision is final.

__Consensus__ involves multiple servers agreeing on values. Once they reach a decision on a value, that decision is final.

Some or all of the servers might fail (non-Byzantine). As long as a majority of the servers remain in the cluster the consensus is ongoing.

## So how does Raft work?

---

## The Raft algorithm

### The majority rule
The majority rule states that given _f_ nodes, if _f/2 + 1_ nodes settled upon a value, then a majority of the nodes have agreed upon a value and that value is final.

---

## The Raft algorithm

### Roles
* Follower: It accepts commands from the leader. It can also vote
in an election process.
* Candidate: A candidate is a node that tries to become a leader through an election process.
* Leader: Handles all client interactions and manages log replication.
